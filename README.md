# Tilted Online

This framework was created to enable multiplayer in Bethesda games, at the moment two games are supported ; **Skyrim Special Edition** and **Fallout 4**.

The work effort for Skyrim Special Edition is mostly provided by the **Skyrim Together** team, while the Fallout 4 effort will now be provided by the **F4MP** team.

*Remember that this is the experimental branch, so there's no guarantee the mod will work or even compile.*
