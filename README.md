This framework was created to enable multiplayer in Bethesda games, at the moment two games are supported ; **Skyrim Special Edition** and **Fallout 4**.

*Remember that this is the experimental branch, so there's no guarantee the mod will work or even compile.*

## Building

### Windows

You will need [Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.8 Preview 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2019-v16-8-preview-2/) (the community edition is freely available). **Earlier versions of Visual Studio will not work**. You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you want to build the UI.

Check GETTINGSTARTED.md for the detailed steps.
