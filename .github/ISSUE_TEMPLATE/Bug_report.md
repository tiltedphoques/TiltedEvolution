# READ IF YOU HAVE MODS

**Note**: If you have mods installed, DO NOT submit a bug report. The chances of one of these mods causing the issue is very high, and so, such bug reports are worthless to us.

Keep in mind that it barely makes sense to report bugs on older version and the issue might be fixed already in the latest available version of Skyrim Together. 
-->

*For example:*

v1.1.0

Friendly Tip: most bugs are in fact 100% reproducible - it's nailing down the precise reproduction steps that is the hard part! Bugs that are 80-100% reproducible will save the developers a lot of time and energy and they tend to get more attention too. If you have the time, try and figure out the exact reproduction steps and everybody will benefit. This text will not appear in the actual bug report but is visible to people creating new issues - feel free to remove it if you like.
